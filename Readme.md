Provides a customizable work tab for Misc Robots and Misc Robots++.

This, of course, requires Misc Robots [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=724602224]Steam[/url] and optionally Misc Robots++ [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=747645520]Steam[/url].

Includes support for Fluffy's WorkTab [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725219116]Steam[/url] [url=https://github.com/fluffy-mods/WorkTab]GitHub[/url].
Includes support for Aviuz's Prison Labor [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1899474310]Steam[/url] or [url=https://github.com/Aviuz/PrisonLabor/releases]GitHub[/url].
Includes support for FrozenSnowFox's Complex Jobs [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2069684319]Steam[/url].

Load order is specified in the Mod configuration, but this mod should be loaded AFTER Misc Robots, Misc Robots++, WorkTab and PrisonLabor. Order for Complex Jobs does not matter

This includes some balance changes, as some robots can now do more work, and some less.
