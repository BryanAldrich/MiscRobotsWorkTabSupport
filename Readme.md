[![RimWorld 1.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/RimWorld-1.2-brightgreen.svg)](http://rimworldgame.com/)

Provides a customizable work tab for Misc Robots and Misc Robots++.

This, of course, requires Misc Robots [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=724602224) and optionally Misc Robots++ [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=747645520).

Includes support for Fluffy's WorkTab [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725219116) [Github](https://github.com/fluffy-mods/WorkTab/releases).
Includes support for Aviuz's Prison Labor [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1899474310) or [Github](https://github.com/Aviuz/PrisonLabor/releases).
Includes support for FrozenSnowFox's Complex Jobs [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2069684319).

Load order is specified in the Mod configuration, but this mod should be loaded AFTER Misc Robots, Misc Robots++, WorkTab and PrisonLabor. Order for Complex Jobs does not matter

This includes some balance changes, as some robots can now do more work, and some less.
